# Hora

## Summary

I &hearts; Open Source software, but it can be a little tricky keeping track of all the similar projects out there.

Hora helps you keep track of the open source projects that are on Github! Make lists of different repositories and share them with the community!

## Lists

I love lists. I was heavily inspired by sites like [staticsitegenerators.net](http://staticsitegenerators.net/) and [staticgen.com](https://www.staticgen.com/), as well as [my own manual tweet of startgazers](https://twitter.com/thomasreggi/status/463383077772079104) and I just wanted an easy way to create a list of repos, and have the repo data get imported.

## The Name

> There once were two watchmakers, named Hora and Tempus, who made very fine watches. The phones in their workshops rang frequently; new customers were constantly calling them. However, Hora prospered while Tempus became poorer and poorer. In the end, Tempus lost his shop. What was the reason behind this? The watches consisted of about 1000 parts each. The watches that Tempus made were designed such that, when he had to put down a partly assembled watch (for instance, to answer the phone), it immediately fell into pieces and had to be reassembled from the basic elements.

> Hora had designed his watches so that he could put together subassemblies of about ten components each. Ten of these subassemblies could be put together to make a larger sub- assembly. Finally, ten of the larger subassemblies constituted the whole watch. Each subassembly could be put down without falling apart.

I designed this project with the philosophy I stole from this parable above. Hora build his watches in modules (not the node kind), I did the same thing. I started out by making the model and building a Command Line Interface (CLI) that could use the model, just as the Node.js server API eventually would.
